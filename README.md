# MTensor: Multi-Dimensional Quantum-Inspired Tensor Framework

# Overview

MTensor is an advanced, multi-dimensional tensor framework designed for complex data representation and manipulation. 
It combines concepts from quantum computing, fractal geometry, and advanced mathematics to create a versatile tool for various cutting-edge applications.
In short MTensor is a 5 Dimensional, Fractal Tensor with Quantum Entanglement properties and is unlike anything ever seen.

# Key Features:

5-Dimensional Structure: Default shape of (2, 4, 4, 4, 4), allowing for rich, multi-layered data representation.

Complex Number Representation: Uses complex numbers for each element, enabling phase and magnitude information storage.

Quantum-Inspired Operations: Incorporates quantum computing concepts for unique data transformations.

Adaptive Rank Optimization: Automatically finds the optimal rank for tensor decomposition.

Fractal Components: Integrates fractal-like behavior for self-similarity across scales.

Tensor Fusion and Absorption: Ability to combine and absorb information from other tensors.

Evolutionary Capabilities: Can evolve over time, simulating dynamic systems.

Holographic Encoding: Supports holographic-like data representation.

Fourier Domain Operations: Enables frequency-domain analysis and manipulation.

Dimensionality Reduction: Built-in methods for reducing high-dimensional data to lower dimensions.


# Unique Characteristics:

Quantum-Classical Hybrid: Blends classical tensor operations with quantum-inspired concepts.

Multi-Scale Representation: Fractal components allow for patterns at various scales.

Dynamic Adaptability: Can evolve and adapt its structure based on incoming data or operations.

Complex Information Encoding: Uses both magnitude and phase for richer data representation.

Flexible Dimensionality: Can work across multiple dimensions, from 3D to 5D and potentially beyond.


# Layman's Explanation of Uniqueness

Imagine a super-advanced Rubik's Cube. Now, instead of just colors, each square on the cube contains a tiny universe of information. This cube can twist and turn in ways that a normal Rubik's Cube can't â€“ it can even absorb information from other cubes or evolve over time. It's like if you combined a Rubik's Cube with a crystal ball, a supercomputer, and a little bit of magic. That's what makes MTensor unique!

It's a way to represent and manipulate incredibly complex information in a structure that can adapt, evolve, and perform operations inspired by some of the most advanced concepts in physics and mathematics.
Whilst also simplyfiying the way in which we can reason about, what it is that the tensor is doing.

# Inspiration

Google recently purchased a company called DeepMind here in the UK which came up with AlphaTensor, now AlphaTensor is an attempt to make things easier for mathematicians by finding unique matrix multiplication algorithims. 
This will aid and assist many mathematicians considerably don't get me wrong. However I have to work on some of the Hardest class of number theoretical research areas, including the largest class of prime numbers and unfortunaley whats offered is good. It's not going to be nearly enough for my needs. Therefore MTensor was born and with it a full redesign of what I think a tensor needs to look like to deal with these types of complex issues.
